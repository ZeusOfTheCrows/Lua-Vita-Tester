Lua Vita Tester
==================

A simple homebrew for testing the input data on the PS Vitaâ„¢ made on [Lua Player Plus Vita](https://github.com/Rinnegatamante/lpp-vita)

This is a fork of SMOKE5's [VitaTester](https://github.com/SMOKE5/VitaTester)    
This project was done mainly for self learning purposes.
**At no point am I claiming this as mine,** this was just made to test myself that I 
could convert it over to Lua Player Plus Vita for PS Vita made by: Rinnegatamante
since I'm still learning and it was made as a fun learning experience.
